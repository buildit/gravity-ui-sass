Got questions, ideas or feedback? Need some help? The Gravity team's got your back!

## For colleagues
The preferred way to get in touch with us is via the [`#buildit-gravity` channel](https://wiprodigital.slack.com/messages/C5E0XDQ83) in the Wipro Digital Slack. (If you are a Wipro employee and do not yet have Slack access, you can [create an account](https://wiprodigital.slack.com/signup) yourself!). Just join the channel, say hi and ask away.

## For external folks
We don't really have a good way for external folks to contact us just yet. In the meantime, feel free to drop the Gravity team lead, [James Nash](mailto:james.nash@wipro.com), an email though.

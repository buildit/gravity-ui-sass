##Â Purpose

This is a generic card which is composed of an image, a title and some description.

There is also the option of an anchor wrapping the image `<img>` and title `<h3>` elements. If there is an anchor around the image the image will be decorated with an inward notch. Within the anchor, directly after the `img` you may optionally place an `svg` element which will be used as a decorative icon on hover. 

Currently this card only supports the title being below the image as the notch will be created on the bottom edge of the image.

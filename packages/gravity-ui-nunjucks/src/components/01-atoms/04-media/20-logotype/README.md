## Purpose

Use this component wherever the Buildit logotype (i.e. the stylised "buildit @ wipro digital" text) needs to be displayed.

It uses the `inline-svg-symbol` atom (and therefore depends on `symbols.svg` having been inlined into your HTML document), but hard-codes the correct symbol ID and also sets the intrinsic width and height.

# Purpose

Using a column layout class (optionally with an extra list specific class) gives lists (ul or ol) a column layout.

Gravity provides two versions of the column layout class out of the box: `.grav-o-two-column` and `.grav-o-four-column`. These determine the number of columns the layout has at the largest viewport. Columns will break down to lower counts on smaller viewports.

Lists also require the `.grav-o-column-list` class if you want to remove the default list bullet style and padding.

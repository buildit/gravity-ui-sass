##Â Purpose

This is the component for use as the page heading.

It consists of a `<h1>` as the page title, a `<p>` for a short description of the page, an optional `<time>` to display a date related to this content (usually publication date), and an optional `<img>` which will automatically gain a downward pointing notch.

The class should be added to a `<div>` or a `<header>` element as appropriate. The `<header>` element should be used when semantically correct to do so; such as within another sectioning element like `<article>`.
For reference, the sectioning elements are `<body>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<nav>`.

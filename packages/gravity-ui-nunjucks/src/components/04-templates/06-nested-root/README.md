Example of a simple page whose top-level contents are not direct descendents of the `<body>` element, but instead wrapped in an intermediate container element. This is a pattern commonly used in single page apps (SPA), where a JavaScript framework expects to control all the DOM elements below a specific "root" element. Some frameworks, like React, [advise against using `<body>` as that root](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/two-weird-tricks-that-fix-react-7cf9bbdef375) though, so people commonly use a nested `<div>` or similar as their appication's root.

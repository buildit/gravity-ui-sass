##Â Purpose

This is the component for use as the page heading.

It consists of a `<h1>` as the page title, a `<p>` for a short description of the page, an optional `<time>` to display a date related to this content (usually publication date), and an optional `<img>` which will automatically gain a downward pointing notch.

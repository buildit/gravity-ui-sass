##Â Purpose

This is a generic card which is composed of an image, a title, some description and optionally some tags.

There is also the option of an anchor wrapping the image `<img>` and title `<h3>` elements. If there is an anchor around the image the image will be decorated with an inward notch.

Currently this card only supports the title being below the image as the notch will be created on the bottom edge of the image.

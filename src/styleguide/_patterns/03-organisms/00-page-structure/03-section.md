## Purpose

The section is just a way to organise a document, it should be used with understanding of its semantic meaning.

For more information read [HTML5 articles and sections: what's the difference?](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/html5-articles-and-sections-whats-the-difference/).

The pattern currently has the capacity of hosting a title (`<h2>`) followed by any repetition of the following elements:

- paragraph
- blockquote
- unordered list
- list-inline-row
- list-img-cards
- list-image-links

The pseudo-pattern ~banner showcases a state in which the section is styled with a coloured background that encompasses one end of the viewport to the other i.e. with no margin.

The banner uses the container-banner stylesheet, and should ideally be used to group certain elements that are intended to stand out/be seperate from the rest of the page.

##Â Purpose

This type of button is used exclusively for handling the menu toggle on the header.

Its default state has been defined on dark background while it has a light version that is triggered with the `.is-light` class in a parent container, or using the BEM style modifier `.grav-c-toggle-menu--inverted`.

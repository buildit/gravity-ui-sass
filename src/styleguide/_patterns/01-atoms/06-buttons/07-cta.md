## Purpose

The CTA (or Call To Action) is a button with the primary intention of grabbing the user attention and direct them somewhere else.

A submit button is _not_ a CTA. A _read more_ link **is**.

The CTA can be used on a `<button>` or as an `<a>` by simply appending the right class to the container.

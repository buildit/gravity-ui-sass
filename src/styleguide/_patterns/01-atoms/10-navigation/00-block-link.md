## Purpose

Block Links are simply Links that have been styled to appear visually similar to buttons. This helps them stand out and also increases the clickable area, making them easier to click or tap.

They are primarily used within navigation menus, but may be used _sparingly_ for attention-grabbing links elsewhere on pages.

The placeholder variant (where, the `href` attribute is absent), has a visually distinct style. This is for use within navigation menus, where a placeholder link is used to indicate the current page or section.

## Purpose

An `input` is used to capture data input from the user. A `type` attribute should be provided so the appropiate native UI can be provided for different input types e.g. `text`, `email`, `password` etc.

If the input must be completed in order to process the form successfully then a `required` attribute can be added. This will prevent the form being submitted until the `input` has a value.
